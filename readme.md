Arabic Tweets Data
====
Arabic Tweets from the Qatar Institute are prepared in a few convenient formats
for use at the DataKind datadive. The data are reshaped and subsetted in a few
different ways and are converted into a few different formats for fast loading
into different programs. A server build script is also created so that we can
deploy a few servers and load the data into the respective programs before the
datadive starts.
